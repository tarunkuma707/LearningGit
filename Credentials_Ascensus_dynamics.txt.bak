%HIDE%(^PlanType^ != {401(k)} AND ^PlanType^ != {403(b)} AND ^PlanType^ != {Profit Sharing} AND ^PlanType^ != {MPP})Need to update the TRD for Ascensus FP MVP2

The Pricing Tool will need to be updated for the following:

Use the SimplySecureLite Fee Schedule and Fee Schedule item to calculate the 3(16) fees when the SimplySecureLite option is selected as the 3(16) Service Label, this should work similar to how the SimplySecure and SimplySecureMore Fee Schedules that we have today are working to set the 3(16) fees.

Use the new RK Revenue Share Schedule (John Hancock Enterprise Plus) when the Division is John Hancock Enterprise Plus, Service is John Hancock Enterprise Plus, and Sub Service is Enterprise Plus.

Use the rate in the new JH Enterprise Plus Payroll Processing Additional Service item to calculate Payroll Processing if the Payroll Submission Frequency field is set to an option other than none and the Division is John Hancock Enterprise Plus. This calculation should be the same as the payroll processing calculation that is done today but use the fee from the new Additional Service record. The regular Payroll Processing Additional Service record should still be used if the Division is anything other than John Hancock Enterprise Plus.

Use the new ESOP Fee Schedule and Fee Schedule items to calculate the fees if the Plan Type is ESOP. The fee schedule will be setup with the Revenue Share Passed to Client (y/n) field set to No so that the Revenue Share section is not displayed in the proposals but should still allow for this to be updated to Yes to have the Revenue Share section display if needed similar to how the tool is coded today.

Do not display Annual contributions (estimated) row in proposal output if Plan Type is ESOP.

Update the Plan Design and document drafting row label to Setup/Conversion fee when the Plan Type is ESOP.

Do not display the Custodial services provided by Matrix fee row in the proposal when the Plan Type is ESOP even if the Service is set to FuturePlan.

Please see attached word docx! Thanks!
